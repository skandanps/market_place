# market_place

The Market Place project was designed to serve as a platform for managing and selling products. The project includes separate login pages for admin, business holder, and customers. Admins have access to customer reports, while business holder can generate selling reports. Customers have the ability to create clubs based on their specific goals and requirements. Additionally, customers can interact with business holder to address any inquiries they may have.

To implement this project, a combination of technologies was utilized, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, and the Laravel framework. These technologies enable the development of a dynamic and interactive user interface, as well as the implementation of server-side functionalities to handle data management and communication between different user roles.
